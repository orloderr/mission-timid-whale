These assets were copied from the `build` directory of the [phaser-ce](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce) repository and the Typescript type definitions were copied from the `typescript` directory.

See `version.txt` in this directory for the current version of the library. If a newer version of the library is available, do the following to upgrade:
1. Clone the phaser-ce repository to your machine
2. Run the following to replace the necessary assets: `./upgrade-phaser.sh <path-to-phaser-ce-repo>`

NOTE: I've only provided a shell script here. If you are using a non-Linux operating system you should be able to follow the contents of `upgrade-phaser.sh` and perform the steps manually.
